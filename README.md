# 05 Alien, Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

# Description

Work Day Scheduler is a time management tool designed for busy professionals, allowing them to easily create, track, and store daily tasks and appointments during regular office hours.

# Tasks

Display the current day at the top of the calendar.
Provide timeblocks for standard business hours (9am–5pm).
Color-code timeblocks to indicate whether they are in the past, present, or future.
Allow users to click into a timeblock and enter an event.
Implement a save button to store event text in local storage.
Ensure that saved events persist even after page refresh.
